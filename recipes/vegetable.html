    <h4>Steps in preparing Vegetable soup:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the water leaves and fluted pumpkin leaves with a kitchen knife.
            You can wash the water leaves after slicing them. Wash the leaves properly and transfer into a sieve to strain excess water. You don’t want too much water in your vegetable soup.
        </li>
        <li>Wash the roasted fish, remove center bone and break to smaller bits. Season the goat meat with a teaspoon of salt, sliced onions and two seasoning cubes. 
            Season the goat meat with a teaspoon of salt, sliced onions and two seasoning cubes. Allow the meat to boil, add two cups of water and let the meat cook until it becomes tender and easy to chew.
        </li>
        <li>To the boiling meat, add the washed, roasted fish. Allow them to cook until the water dries. Don’t allow it to burn.</li>
        <li>When the meat cooked and the water is almost completely dried, add the palm oil, 400ml. You need lots of palm oil when you cook vegetable soup. </li>
        <li> Add the vegetables and stir all together. Taste for salt, and add salt to your taste. You don’t want too much salt.</li>
        <li>Allow the vegetable soup simmer for three minutes and your vegetable soup is ready to be served.</li>
    </ol>
